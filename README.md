- Developed a hybrid model using Decision Trees and CNN to more efficiently solve the problem of credit card fraud detection.
- The repository contains the following 3 files:
  - DT-CNN.py - contains the code to the final hybrid model. Run the following command to reproduce the metrics: `python3 DT-CNN.py`
  - cnn-credit.py - contains the code to the individual CNN model with 2 conv1d layers, 2 max pool layers and 1 dense layer
  - decisionTree.py - contains the code to the individual DT model
